  Eventually, users will be able to give Figma access to their fonts with a single click. But until Chrome and Firefox
  implement that capability, we’re stuck using a work-around. We’ve designed a solution with your security in mind, and
  we’ve made it easy to set up.
  When you run the installer, you will be installing a process which monitors your computer’s fonts folder and keeps the
  tool up-to-date with your fonts.
  Your web browser communicates with the process, which only responds to requests from our domain. One thing to keep in
  mind is that the process will run in the background until you tell it to stop. The program is extremely lightweight,
  so it won't eat up resources on your computer.
  If you ever change your mind, you can easily uninstall the process.
